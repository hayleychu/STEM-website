<h2>What is STEM?</h2>
<div class="text">
  STEM is an approach to learning and development that integrates the areas of 
  science, technology, engineering and mathematics.<br><br>
</div>

<h2>What STEM careers are there?</h2>

<div class="text">
  There is a large variety of STEM careers, including but not limited to:<br>
  <ul>
    <li>Statistician<br></li>
    <li>Mathematician<br></li>
    <li>Physicist<br></li>
    <li>Doctor<br></li>
    <li>Software developer<br></li>
    <li>Engineer<br></li>
    <li>Research scientist<br></li>
    <li>Biochemist<br></li>
    <li>Accountant<br></li>
  </ul>

<h2>Why is STEM important?</h2>
<div class="text">
  The global economy is changing. Current jobs are disappearing due to automation 
  and new jobs are emerging every day as a result of technological advances.<br><br>
  The continual advances in technology are changing the way students learn, connect 
  and interact every day. Skills developed by students through STEM provide them 
  with the foundation to succeed at school and beyond.<br><br>
  Employer demand for STEM qualifications and skills is high, and will continue to 
  increase in the future. Currently, 75 percent of jobs in the fastest growing 
  industries require workers with STEM skills. To be competitive, the global 
  workforce needs people who can adapt to a changing workplace.<br><br>
  STEM empowers individuals with the skills to succeed and adapt to this changing 
  world. <br><br>

<h2>Gender inequality in STEM</h2>
<img src="file:///Users/student/Documents/Hayley%20Chu%20YCIS/13B/Computer%20Science/CS%20IA%20Documentation/Statistics.jpg" alt="STEM" style="float:left;width:350px;margin-left:80px;margin-right:50px;margin-top:8px;">
<div class="text">
  Gender discrimination in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields 
  is a problem that is now well recognized.<br><br>
  Women are less likely to choose STEM majors and get STEM degrees and jobs than men. 
  This is true even though women do as well or better than men on STEM tests and 
  projects. The disparity is strongest in the physical sciences, computer science, 
  math, and engineering. Women make up only ~20% of students in these majors in the 
  U.S.  The number of women majoring in computer science has decreased since the 
  1990s. A smaller percentage of women get jobs in those fields. Women who work in 
  STEM fields report more gender discrimination at work. This is worst for women with 
  advanced degrees and in STEM fields where men outnumber women.<br><br>
