<h2>Welcome to the Meet a "STEMist" Day website!</h2>
<div class="text">
  This whole-school event was established with the aim of encouraging students 
  in our school community to learn more about STEM and careers in STEM, and to 
  raise awareness of gender inequality in the STEM field.<br><br>
  This website was created to provide information on this event and to allow 
  students like you to learn about what STEM entails and to register for your 
  favourite sessions.<br><br>
  Join us on March 10, 2021 and participate in interactive science experiments, 
  coding workshops, exciting activities, career talks and more!
