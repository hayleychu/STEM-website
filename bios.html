<h2>Cynthia Breazeal</h2>

<div class="text">
  Cynthia Breazeal was born in Albuquerque, New Mexico. She received her bachelor 
  of science degree in electrical and computer engineering from University of 
  California–Santa Barbara in 1989, and her doctor of science degree in electrical 
  engineering and computer science from Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 
  2000. At MIT, Breazeal worked in the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory under 
  Rodney A. Brooks, fabled pioneer of the actionist approach to robotics. For her 
  doctoral dissertation, she developed Kismet, a highly expressive humanoid robot 
  capable of unscripted, emotionally intuitive, and hence lifelike interaction with 
  human beings.<br><br>
  Following the breakthrough with Kismet, Breazeal helped develop a number of more 
  sophisticated robots utilizing similar principles, including Cog, Leonardo, and 
  Nexi. The general term now in use for these more-advanced descendants of Kismet 
  is “MDS” (mobile, dexterous, social) robots. Several commercial spin-offs have 
  been derived from her work, as well, including the personal trainer, Autom, the 
  interactive robot companion, Huggable, and the enhanced video-conferencing system, 
  MeBot. Breazeal is currently Director of the Personal Robots Group under the aegis 
  of MIT’s famed Media Lab.<br><br>

<h2>Roger Penrose</h2>

<div class="text">
  Roger Penrose is a British mathematician and relativist who in the 1960s 
  calculated many of the basic features of black holes.<br><br>
  Penrose became interested in the problem of defining consciousness and wrote 
  two books in which he argued that quantum mechanics is needed to explain the 
  conscious mind—The Emperor’s New Mind (1989) and Shadows of the Mind (1994). 
  He also wrote The Road to Reality (2004), an extensive overview of mathematics 
  and physics. In Cycles of Time: An Extraordinary New View of the Universe (2010), 
  Penrose posited his theory of conformal cyclic cosmology, formulating the Big Bang 
  as an endlessly recurring event. He received the Copley Medal of the Royal Society 
  in 2008.<br><br>
  For his work on black holes, he was awarded the 2020 Nobel Prize for Physics. 
  He shared the prize with American astronomer Andrea Ghez and German astronomer 
  Reinhard Genzel.<br><br>

<h2>Vivian Yam</h2>

<div class="text">
  Vivian Yam is a Hong Kong chemist and part of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. She 
  was elected to the Academy in 2001, becoming the youngest member.<br><br>
  In 2011, she won the Asia-Pacific L’Oréal-Unesco Award for Women in Science “for 
  her work on light-emitting materials and innovative ways of capturing solar 
  energy”.<br><br>
  Yam’s research on organic light-emitting diodes, which are brighter and make 
  better use of energy than the older light-emitting diodes, has helped create more 
  efficient displays on mobile phones and laptops.<br><br>
